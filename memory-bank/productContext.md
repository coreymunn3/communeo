# Product Context: Communeo

## Problem Statement

Current social and community platforms face several significant challenges:

1. **Quality Dilution**: Popular platforms like Reddit often suffer from low-quality content drowning out valuable contributions.

2. **Expertise Ambiguity**: It's difficult to distinguish between genuine experts and casual commenters, leading to misinformation and confusion.

3. **Reward Misalignment**: Most platforms reward engagement metrics (likes, comments) rather than quality or accuracy of content.

4. **Content Accessibility**: Long-form content can be inaccessible due to length, language barriers, or format limitations.

5. **Monetization Challenges**: Content creators and experts struggle to monetize their knowledge and contributions effectively.
