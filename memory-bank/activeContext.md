# Active Context: Communeo

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features of Communeo. The project is more than halfway complete, with several key features already implemented and functioning.

## Recent Changes

Recent development has focused on:

1. **Community Creation**: Users can create communities with custom rules, flairs, and descriptions
2. **Post Creation**: Support for text, image, and link posts
3. **Commenting System**: Nested comments with threading
4. **Voting System**: Upvoting and downvoting on posts and comments
5. **User Authentication**: Integration with Clerk for user management
6. **Community Membership**: Joining and leaving communities
7. **Enhanced Search**: Contextual search functionality across posts, communities, and users
8. **Responsive UI**: Mobile and desktop layouts

## Priority Items

The following items are currently prioritized for development:

1. **Sorting and Filtering**:

   - Implement sorting posts by newest, highest score
   - Filter posts by flair within communities
   - Sort comments by newest, highest score

2. **User Profile Enhancement**:

   - ✅ Complete user page build out
   - ✅ Display user activity (posts, comments, communities)
   - ✅ Show user statistics and history
   - ✅ Enhance user-specific search capabilities

3. **Content Management**:

   - Implement post editing and deletion
   - Implement comment editing and deletion
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

4. **Moderation Tools**:

   - Community moderation controls
   - Post removal functionality
   - Comment moderation features

5. **Public Access**:

   - Enable content viewing without authentication
   - Redirect to login only when actions require authentication
   - Ensure security while allowing public access

6. **Authentication UI**:
   - Customize Clerk elements to match application design
   - Improve sign-in and sign-up flows

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Optimize database queries for feed generation
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders

2. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Ensure proper authorization checks
   - Protect against common vulnerabilities
   - Rate limiting for public endpoints

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Refactor components for better reusability
   - Improve type definitions
   - Enhance error handling

## Design Decisions

1. **UI Consistency**:

   - Maintain consistent styling across all components
   - Ensure dark/light mode works correctly throughout the application
   - Improve responsive behavior on different devices

2. **User Experience**:
   - Enhance feedback for user actions
   - Improve loading states and transitions
   - Optimize form validation and error messages

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. Complete the sorting and filtering functionality for posts and comments
2. Implement post and comment editing/deletion
3. Implement moderation tools for community moderators
4. Enable public access to content while maintaining security
5. Customize authentication UI to match the application design

## Known Issues

1. Public access is currently limited due to auth protection
2. Some UI components need refinement for better responsiveness
3. Performance optimizations needed for larger data sets

This active context document will be updated as development progresses and priorities shift.
