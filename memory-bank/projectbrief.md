# Project Brief: Communeo

## Overview

Communeo is a community-driven platform inspired by Reddit but with significant enhancements, particularly in the area of AI-powered features. The platform allows users to create communities, share posts, engage in discussions, and vote on content. What sets Communeo apart is its focus on identifying and rewarding genuine expertise and high-quality contributions through AI capabilities.

## Core Objectives

- Create a robust community platform with all essential features of a modern forum
- Implement AI capabilities to enhance content quality and user experience
- Build mechanisms to identify and validate genuine expertise within communities
- Develop a platform that rewards high-quality contributions and expert knowledge
- Eventually enable monetization opportunities for users who demonstrate expertise

## Target Audience

- Users seeking quality community discussions with reduced noise
- Subject matter experts looking to share knowledge and be recognized
- People who want AI-enhanced content consumption and creation
- Communities that value verified expertise and high-quality contributions

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI-Enhanced Experience**: Unlike traditional forums, Communeo leverages AI to improve content quality, accessibility, and interaction.

2. **Expertise Validation**: The platform aims to distinguish between genuine experts and casual contributors through AI analysis and community validation.

3. **Quality-Focused**: By rewarding thoughtful, well-researched contributions, Communeo encourages higher quality content than typical social platforms.
